       <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the core language used to create and structure content on the web. It forms the backbone of every website, defining how text, images, videos, and links are displayed in a browser. Since its inception in the early 1990s by Tim Berners-Lee, HTML has evolved significantly, becoming more versatile and powerful to meet the growing demands of the internet.<br></p>
       <h3>What is HTML<br></h3>
       <p>HTML is a markup language, which means it uses a system of tags to denote different elements on a webpage. These tags are enclosed in angle brackets, and they tell the browser how to interpret the text between them. For example, the < p > tag is used to define paragraphs, while the < h1 > tag is used for the main heading of a webpage. Together, these tags structure the content in a way that is both human-readable and machine-readable.<br></p>
       <p>The language is relatively simple to learn compared to other programming languages, as it focuses on structure rather than logic or complex computations. It doesn’t require variables, functions, or conditions, making it an excellent starting point for beginners in web development.<br></p>
       <h3>Structure of an HTML Document<br></h3>
       <p>An HTML document is composed of several essential components, starting with the < !DOCTYPE html > declaration, which tells the browser that the document follows the latest HTML5 standards. The entire content is then wrapped in the < html > tag, which contains two major sections: the < head > and the < body >.<br></p>
       <section style="text-align: left;">
        <p><b>1.Head Section:</b>The < head > section contains metadata, which is information about the webpage that is not displayed directly. This can include the title of the page, which appears in the browser tab, as well as links to stylesheets (CSS) and scripts (JavaScript).<br>
            <b>2.Body Section:</b>The < body > section holds the visible content, such as text, images, and links. This is where most of the webpage’s design and interactivity takes place.</p>
       </section>
       <h3>Importance of HTML in Web Development<br></h3>
       <p>HTML is essential because it lays the foundation for all websites. Every web page you visit, from social media platforms to blogs, is built using HTML. While HTML alone provides the basic structure, it can be combined with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create more visually appealing and interactive websites.<br>
        <section style="text-align: left;">
            <b>CSS:</b>allows developers to style their HTML content by changing the color, layout, and fonts, making the site more attractive.<br>
            <b>JavaScript:</b>enables dynamic content and interaction, allowing users to interact with elements on the page, such as clicking buttons or filling out forms.<br></section>
        Without HTML, the web would not exist in the form we know today. It is the first step in web development and serves as a bridge between human-friendly content and machine-readable code.<br>
        <h3>HTML's Evolution<br></h3>
        <p>HTML has gone through several revisions, with each version bringing new features and capabilities. HTML5, the latest version, introduced several important features like support for video and audio without needing plugins, better semantic elements, and enhanced capabilities for mobile-friendly websites. These improvements have made HTML more powerful and capable of handling the complexities of modern web development.<br></p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>HTML is the bedrock of the internet, serving as the essential building block for web development. It provides the structure that developers enhance using CSS and JavaScript, allowing for the creation of dynamic, interactive, and visually appealing websites. Learning HTML is the first step for anyone interested in entering the field of web development, as it forms the basis of all web technologies. Understanding HTML gives you a window into how the web works and empowers you to create your own content on the internet.<br></p>
